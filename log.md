# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp's algorithm on Smallest Common Multiples

**Thoughts:** Very math-heavy for 10pm fighting sickness. I think I have a decent start, but next is going to be some sort of loop (recursion?) to do these calculations for every number in the range.

### Day 2: May 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** FCC's algorithms: Smallest Common Multiples and Finders Keepers

**Thoughts:** In typical FCC fashion, after the SCM algorithm took me two hours to solve, the following challenge (Finders Keepers) took me less than two minutes. The challenge was literally to implement the Array.prototype.filter() function, and return only the first item filtered. I didn't even add my solution to my github because it seemed too simple? I guess I'll add it for propriety or whatever.
