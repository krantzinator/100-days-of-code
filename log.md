# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp's algorithm on Smallest Common Multiples

**Thoughts:** Very math-heavy for 10pm fighting sickness. I think I have a decent start, but next is going to be some sort of loop (recursion?) to do these calculations for every number in the range.
